# Prompt History

## 2025-11-28
**User Request**: Do you remember what i told you last chat?

**Context**: User asked if I remember previous conversation. I explained I don't have access to previous chat history.

**Follow-up**: User wants me to create a file to save all prompts so I can read what was asked last time. They specifically mentioned wanting me to use the way they've been committing and their gitflow that they've been using.

**Git Analysis**: Based on recent commit history, user follows conventional commits with:
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types used: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`
- Scopes: `backend`, `client`, `project`, `gitignore`, `structure`
- Clear, descriptive messages
- Active development on what appears to be a multiplayer game with Unity client and Node.js backend

**Action Taken**: Created this prompt-history.md file to track user requests and analyzed git commit patterns for future reference.
